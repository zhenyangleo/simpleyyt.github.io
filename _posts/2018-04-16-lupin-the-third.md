So here he comes, right on time    
是他来了，分秒不差    
And he has class, 'n quite a style    
器宇轩昂，眉色飞扬    
All of his own and they all know him     
人们都称他    
As Lupin, the third    
大名鼎鼎的鲁邦三世    
He walks the line, one fine line    
他履险蹈危，单刀赴会    
Though danger lies, he'll be just fine    
他泰山崩前，面色不改    
He's here today but gone tomorrow    
他行踪不定，来鸿去燕    
He's Lupin, the third    
他就是鲁邦三世    
All his life has been    
他的人生    
One roller coaster ride of dreams    
是一辆开往梦的过山车    
No time for looking back    
无暇回首      
Never regretting that    
绝无悔憾    
His smile is all that he can leave behind    
留给世界的只有背影和微笑    
And there he goes, nice and slow    
他如云彩般飘忽    
Wish he would stay, another day    
或许哪一个无风的日子，他会停留    
So we can dance, darkness away    
我们跳舞狂欢，驱散阴暗    
My Lupin, the third    
我的鲁邦三世    
 

All his life has been    
他的人生    
One roller coaster ride of dreams    
是一辆开往梦的过山车    
No time for looking back    
无暇回首    
Forgetting who or what    
绝无悔憾    
His song is all that he can leave behind    
留给世界的只有背影和歌声    
On silent night, I hear him still    
静寂的夜晚，回响在我耳畔    
Whisting a tune I know so well      
是他那熟悉的旋律和哨音    
Gun in hand, rose in another    
左手玫瑰，右手短枪    
He's Lupin, the third     
他是，鲁邦三世
